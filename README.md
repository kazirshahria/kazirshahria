# Hello Universe ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kazi Shahria. I am a senior at Baruch College. Over the years, my interests changed to dealing more with data and numbers. With so much information collected, I wonder how much is known and unknown and what can and can't be done. I love asking questions and finding answers to those questions. Learning about the data science path allowed me to discover new hobbies and interests. I love experimenting, writing code, and playing detective. Uncovering secrets and finding the "why" gives a lot of leverage for a business (and myself). I am currently improving my background in programming, machine learning, and mathmatics because I want to pursue this career and find the beauty in data.
