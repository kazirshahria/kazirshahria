# Hello Universe ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kazi Shahria. I am a senior at Baruch College, I am currently working on projects and looking for a full-time opportunity for the summer of 2024.

The data science path allowed me to discover new hobbies and interests. I love problem-solving, writing code, and learning new things. I am currently improving my background in programming, machine learning, and mathmatics. Feel free to reach out to me on Linkedin!
