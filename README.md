# Hello 👋

My name is Kazi Shahria. I am an undergraduate student at Baruch College. Over the years, my interests changed to dealing more with data and numbers. With so much information collected per second, I wonder how much is known and unknown and what can and can't be done. I love asking questions and finding answers to those questions. Learning about the data science path was the right career, I like experimenting, writing code, and playing detective. Uncovering secrets and finding the "why" gives a lot of leverage for a business. I am improving my background in programming, data science, and math because I want to pursue this career and find the beauty in data.

## Quick Facts About Me:
