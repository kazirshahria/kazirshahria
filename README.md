# Hello Universe ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kazi Shahria. I am a senior at Baruch College, I am currently working on projects and looking for internship or full-time opportunities for the summer of 2024.

Learning about the data science path allowed me to discover new hobbies and interests. I love experimenting, writing code, and playing detective. I am currently improving my background in programming, machine learning, and mathmatics.
