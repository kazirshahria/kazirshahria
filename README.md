# Hello 👋

My name is Kazi Shahria. I am an undergraduate student at Baruch College. I have become interested in learning and trying many things throughout my years. I used to edit videos, produce beats, create websites, run businesses, etc. I have interned in industries such as finance and marketing. Over the years, my interests changed to dealing more with data and numbers. With so much information collected every second, I wonder how much is known and unknown and what can and can't be done. I love asking questions and finding answers to those questions. Learning about the Data Science path was the right career, I like experimenting, writing code, and playing detective. Uncovering secrets and finding why gives a lot of leverage for a business. My past had a purpose to what I am doing now, and I am very proud I was able to test many things, now, I am improving my background in programming, data science, and math because I want to pursue this career and find the beauty in data.
