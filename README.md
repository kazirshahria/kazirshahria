# Hello World

My name is Kazi Shahria. I am a third-year undergraduate student at Baruch College. My interests revolve around data and numbers. With so much information collected across the industry, it makes me wonder how much is known and unknown, and what can be done or what the limitations are, if any. I am always improving my background in programming, data science, and math as they relate back to my interests.

## Quick Facts About Me:
- Studying to become a Data Scientist
