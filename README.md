# 😶‍🌫️ [Kazi Shahria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kazishahria/)

My name is Kazi (Kaa-zee). I am an experienced Python developer with over 5 years of experience in data engineering, data analytics, and machine learning.

My passion is in data. I enjoy cleaning, analyzing, and modeling data. I am also a statistics person who does creative things with numbers.

I am a problem-solver, reliable, and honest individual who appreciates collaborating with others.

I am into puzzle games, fitness, and sports. I used to dream about becoming a pilot but now I wonder about the data.

Currently, I am searching for full-time opportunities near NY or NJ.

Feel free to check out my portfolio. I am sure you'll learn something new. If you'd like to collaborate, provide feedback, or message me then you can reach me via [email](mailto:kazirshahria@gmail.com).

Thank you for your time and attention. Good luck in this world :smile:
